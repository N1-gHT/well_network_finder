# well_network_finder
This python code will find the best well in a network
This code is in progress !
We use networkx and graph to do this
For the moment you need a graph file (text file)  with this partern (node_parent_1,node_child_x,node_child_x...)
We will improving this by using file with coordinates (y and x) and maximum perimeter.
